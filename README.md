Documentation for the Number Manipulator Shiny App for the Data Products class on Coursera

This is a simple app that takes two user entered numbers.

The first number is "Your number."
The second number is "Your multiplier."

When you click the "Calculate!" button, the following information will be displayed:

1. The square root of "Your number"
2. "Your number" squared
3. "Your number" cubed
4. "Your number" times "Your multiplier"

When "Your number" or "Your multiplier" is changed in the text box, the new number will change in the right pane - HOWEVER
the new calculations will not take place until you click the "Calculate!" button.
